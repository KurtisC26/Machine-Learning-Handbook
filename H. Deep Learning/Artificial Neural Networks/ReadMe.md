<h1> Artificial Neural Networks </h1>

The purpose of deep learning is to re-create the structure of the human brain within a machine. In order to do so, we want to try and create neurons...


<h2> Neurons </h2>
Neurons on there own do not have much power, the efficacy of neurons comes in numbers. When you have lots of neurons they work together to build something powerful

Input varaibles need to be standardized / normalized

Output can be:
Continuous
binary
categorical --> Can have multiple output variables y1,y2,y3


For each of the inoput values, weights get attributed. They are crucial, and are the key elements that get modified in the process

Within the neuron, we make sure the weights add up to 1 and then it will apply the activation function
